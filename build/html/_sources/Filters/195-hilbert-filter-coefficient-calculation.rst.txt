    This is the delphi code to create the filter coefficients, which are needed to phaseshift
    a signal by 90Â°
    This may be useful for an evelope detector...
    
    By windowing the filter coefficients you can trade phase response flatness with magnitude
    response flatness.
    
    I had problems checking its response by using a dirac impulse. White noise works fine.
    
    Also this introduces a latency of N/2!

    type TSingleArray = Array of Single;
    
    procedure UncleHilbert(var FilterCoefficients: TSingleArray; N : Integer);
    var i,j : Integer;
    begin
     SetLength(FilterCoefficients,N);
     for i:=0 to (N div 4) do
      begin
       FilterCoefficients[(N div 2)+(2*i-1)]:=+2/(PI*(2*i-1));
       FilterCoefficients[(N div 2)-(2*i-1)]:=-2/(PI*(2*i-1));
      end;
    end;
