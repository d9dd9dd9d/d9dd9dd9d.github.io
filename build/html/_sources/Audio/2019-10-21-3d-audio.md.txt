# 3D Audio

## Introduction
There are many terms used in 3D audio systems.

## System
- `binaural audio`: Weâ€™re given signals to be delivered to the left and right ears, using headphones.
- `transaural audio`: Use loudspeakers to deliver sound, i.e. two speakers on the sides for desktop computer.
















- `minimum phase`: a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable. 
	For systems that have the same magnitude response, the minimum phase system has the minimum group delay, it also has its energy concentrated near the start of the impulse response:
```math
\min\displaystyle\sum_{n=m}^{\infty} |h(n)|^2, \forall m \in \mathbb{Z}^+
```
