    The abs(sin) method from the Lane CMJ paper is not bandlimited! It's basically just a crappy method for BLIT.
    
    You forgot to mention Eli Brandt's minBLEP method. It's the best! You just have to know how to properly generate a nice minblep table... (slightly dilated, see Stilson and Smith BLIT paper, at the end regarding table implementation issues)
