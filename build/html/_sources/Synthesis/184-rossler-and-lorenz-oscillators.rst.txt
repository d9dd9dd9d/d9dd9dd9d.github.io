    The Rossler and Lorenz functions are iterated chaotic systems - they trace smooth curves
    that never repeat the same way twice. Lorenz is "unpitched", having no distinct peaks in
    its spectrum -- similar to pink noise. Rossler exhibits definite spectral peaks against a
    noisy broadband background.
    
    Time-domain and frequency spectrum of these two functions, as well as other info, can be
    found at:

    These functions might be useful in simulating "analog drift."
