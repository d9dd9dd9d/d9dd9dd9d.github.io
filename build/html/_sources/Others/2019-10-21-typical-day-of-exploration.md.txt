# A Typical Day

## Introduction
You can search the paper by its title and look for its pdf on the web. Many authors tend to publish the paper in their personal website, because not all readers are subscribed to the publisher (ieee., etc.). When you can not find the paper as transactions, you may find paper with similar content as conference paper or letters.

Unlike many studies in academic papers, the industrial implementation do have to consider complexity and adaptability. Therefore for most of the time, you only need to know the principle of the topic and find the simplest solution. As a engineer, I think that finding robust and simple solutions are good start for approaching the problem. Then you can dig into the theory and try to improve the solution. 


It is a good thing that we are standing on the shoulders of giants, however sometimes the intuition behind ideas are not conveyed with the ideas itself.
Literature review or introduction part of related paper are excellent start points for attacking on problems. Since many DSP algorithms are proposed in last century, knowing the context may help you better understand the algorithm, especially when you are curious about the intuition behind each algorithms. A good example would be bi-quad filter design, where the names Butterworth and others are originated from the analog filters. 

When browsing papers, I first look at abstracts, then the end of introduction when each section is summarized. Jump to the section you are interested in. Read the conclusion for the author's opinion on their works. 

*I personally find reading the introduction part of the paper most relaxing (this is also the most flexible part of the paper). You can find author's criticism on other people's work, and find interesting things on author's attitude towards different theories and groups (academic circles)*

It is inevitable that you think some paper is Double Dutch (even nonsense). Do not be frustrated, go take a walk or give it a second read tomorrow. End your day knowing that you are heading the right direction. 
I rarely find myself frustrated about the same paper at second time read. I always understand it a bit more, or at least being more familiar with the methods I do not understand.

I do admire people who can learn things fast. However becoming a efficient learner takes tremendous time. You have to gain momentum at the beginning and stick yourself to it.

Many research paper may seem impractical to implement. However their value should not be underestimated, since
