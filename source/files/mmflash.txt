I think I can help you. I have had the same problem, but now I can write
into a FLASH-EEPROM.
Use the file FLASH.asm (Inventory of your Motorola DSP56002EVM
Software).
In the version I use, I find a great mistake !!!
The first rep-command must be rep #6 and not rep#5 (because 64=2^6 and
not 2^5=32).
I wrote a dokumantation about the FLASH-EEprom-Programming, but in
German-Language. I try to explain it:
Use Atmel 29c256 Flash-EEPROM - it works !!!
Assemble your corrected Flash.asm file (asm56000 Flash.asm).
You have created the Flash.cld file.
Start the debugger EVM56k.exe (PC!!!)
Load your usercode (for example echo.cld) into the debugger
- Remember the complete usercode must be in P-memory -
Find out the last address of your usercode in P-memory (look on the
assembly-window). A special trick: Last address to use can be 153F hex !
Load the Flash.cld into the debugger. Flash.cld is behind your usercode
at address 7f00 in P-memory - no conflicts!
Write the last address of your usercode  into the R1-Register.
Command-window: CHANGE R1 153F
Start the EEPRM-Writing-Programm Flash.cld in the debugger:
Command-window: GO 7f00
Now the BOOTSTRAP-COMMAND and your USERCODE will be written in the
FLASH-EEPROM. Wait till the Debugger stops - Debug mode!
Press the reset-button on the EVM-Board. It will boot and start your
userprogramm.
Ready !!!   NO hardware changes nessessary 
            EVM - stand alone 
 Please tell me, if you are successfull!!
