    This is written in Actionscript 3.0 (Flash9). You can listen to the example at
    http://lab.andre-michelle.com/playing-with-pulse-harmonics
    It allows to morph between a sinus like quadratic function and an ordinary pulse width
    with adjustable pulse width. Note that the slope while morphing is always zero at the edge
    points of the waveform. It is not just distorsion.
