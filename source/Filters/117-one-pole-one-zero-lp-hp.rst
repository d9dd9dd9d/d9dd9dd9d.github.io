                  what is n? lol...sorry but i mean this seriously! ;)

    n is the index of sample being considered.
    
    out[] is an array of samples being output, and in[] is the input array. you would construct a loop such that:
    [Pseudocode]
    loop n{0..numsamples-1}
      out[n] = in[n]*a0 + in[n-1]*a1 + out[n-1]*b1;
    end loop;
    [/Pseudocode]
    
    You will need some cleverness so that [n-1] doesn't cause an index error when n=0, but I'll leave that to you :)

    whoops - sorry, of course n = number... stupid me ;)
    interesting code, i will see if can adapt that to delphi, shouldnÂ´t be a big deal :)
    
    i assume i dont need to place either setHPF or LPF into the samples loop, just the block itself?

    absolutey - set the coefficients outside of the loop. There is the case of changes being made whilst the loop is running, depends what platform/host you are writing for.
    
    I'm a delphi code as well. Feel free to use my posted address if you need to :) DSP

    Shouldn't that be float w = 2*PI*fSampling; ???
    
    In which case we can simplify:
    
    void SetLPF(float fCut, float fSampling)
    {
    a0 = fCut/(fSampling+fCut);
    a1 = a0;
    b1 = (fSampling-fCut)/(fSampling+fCut);
    }
    
    void SetHPF(float fCut, float fSampling)
    {
    a0 = fSampling/(fSampling+fCut);
    a1 = -a0;
    b1 = (fSampling-fCut)/(fSampling+fCut);
    }
    
    You can keep the norm = 1/(fSampling+fCut) if you like.
